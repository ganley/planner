# Planner

Weekly planner implemented in Apple Numbers. Perpetually under
construction; some of the TODOs are listed in the Notes page of the
spreadsheet.

Features:
- Mini calendars for current and next month, with the current week (the
  one shown on this planner) highlighted.
- Holidays entered on Holidays tab of spreadsheet are automatically
  shown in the appropriate day of the planner. TODO: highlight those
  holidays in the mini-calendar too.

It's pretty ugly aesthetically speaking; would love for someone with
better color sensibilities than I have to fix that.
